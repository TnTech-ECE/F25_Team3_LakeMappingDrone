## Conceptual Design Revisions
- Here are some of my general comments. Please make sure all formatting throughout the document is consistent and easy to read. Several sections are also missing:
- Remove all specifications/template information from document.
- The overall document needs formatting improvements. For example, in the hardware subsystem, all the interface bullet points sandwiched together are difficult to read. If the bullet points do not belong to the same topic, they need clear separation.
- Introduction needs revision. What problem are you trying to solve here? The problem statement needs to be introduced with relevant background information or citation provided.
- Restating the Fully Formulated Problem is complete missing
- In comparative Analysis of Potential solutions, this is what I am looking for:
- Each potential solution should reflect directly on a subsystem you have identified
- For each subsystem potential solution, include an image and a description of how it works.
- Discuss the metrics that will be used to determine which solution is the best one for the subsystem, make sure you compare in sufficient detail all potential solutions against these metrics. Use cited data to back up your claims and justify the ratings you are giving. This can look like the trade studies we discussed in class.
- Finally, confirm the solution that has been chosen for the subsystem. Now that a solution has been validated and justified, the subsystem specification sections can focus purely on how the solution will work.
-  Hardware Block Diagram and Operational Flow Chart are missing
- The Ethical, professional, and Standards section is missing.
-  Budget needs to be broken into subsystem subtotals, and the final total listed.
-  The division of labor is not detailed enough. Clear justification based on skill sets, classes taken, or work experience should be provided for each person assigned to a subsystem
