## Introduction
This problem affects environmental and local governments who need accurate lakes and reservoir data. This data can then be used for environmental monitoring, flood management, and infrastructure planning. It also impacts fisheries, recreational, and conservation groups. The current lake mapping methods tend to be expensive and require well-trained operators. So, a low cost, autonomous solution would allow for more frequent and efficient data collection without the high cost and specialized skills. This would allow lake mapping to become more expandable and accessible. While commercial sonar and autonomous boats do exist, simply the cost and specific skill set needed to use them limit the availability greatly. Consumer sonar systems may provide depth readings but lack autonomy, data mapping, and integration capabilities. So, a custom-built solution can guarantee affordability, versatility in differing environments, and control over the capacity of the solution’s growth.


## Restating the Fully Formulated Problem

The fully formulated problem is the overall objective and scope complete with the set of shall statements. This was part of the project proposal. However, it may be that the scope has changed. So, state the fully formulated problem in the introduction of the conceptual design and planning document. For each of the constraints, explain the origin of the constraint (customer specification, standards, ethical concern, broader implication concern, etc).


##**Comparative Analysis of Potential Solutions**
The project requires reliable sensing for both **lake bottom depth mapping** and **water current flow measurement**. Selecting the proper technologies for sonar-based depth sensing and flow monitoring is essential to balance affordability, accuracy, integration complexity, and long-term adaptability.


### **Depth Measurement Solutions (Sonar and Transducers)**

- **1. Consumer Fish Finder/Depth Finder Transducers**
 These systems are widely available, often costing under $500, and provide basic point depth readings. While inexpensive and easy to operate, they lack research-quality accuracy, real-time mapping integration, and compatibility with GIS platforms.
- **2. Single-Beam Echo Sounder with Transducer (e.g., Blue Robotics Ping2)**
 Costing approximately $400–$600, these sonar units deliver ±5–15 cm accuracy and support open-source integration with Raspberry Pi and autopilot modules. They are well-suited for proof-of-concept mapping, offering the best balance of affordability, accuracy, and adaptability.
- **3. Survey-Grade Single-Beam Echo Sounders (e.g., CEESCOPE with RTK GNSS)**
 These professional systems achieve ±2–5 cm accuracy and integrate seamlessly into commercial hydrographic workflows. However, their cost exceeds $10,000, making them impractical for a budget-constrained student project.
- **4. Multibeam Sonar Systems**
 Industry-standard for hydrography, multibeam systems provide swath coverage with ±1–2 cm precision. Yet, costs ($50,000–$100,000+) and required RTK-INS navigation systems render them infeasible for this project.


### **Flow Measurement Solutions (Including YF-S201 Sensor)**

- **1. YF-S201 Hall-Effect Flow Sensor**
 The YF-S201 is a low-cost (~$10–$20) sensor that uses a turbine and Hall-effect sensor to measure flow rate. It outputs digital pulses proportional to the water velocity. While not as precise as acoustic methods, it is extremely affordable, lightweight, and easy to integrate with microcontrollers such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi. Its accuracy is typically within ±10% after calibration, making it suitable for small-scale, student-built systems.
- **2. Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs)**
 ADCPs represent the professional standard for water flow measurement, providing full velocity profiles and discharge calculations. They offer high accuracy and reliability but are expensive ($15,000–$30,000+) and require significant power and integration effort.
- **3. Mechanical and Acoustic Flow Meters (e.g., OTT ****Hydromet****)**
 Commercial mechanical and acoustic meters provide accurate point-based velocity measurements. However, they are costly ($5,000–$15,000) and less adaptable for integration into an autonomous platform.

### **Non-Starters**

- **Multibeam sonar** and **survey-grade single-beam** systems are eliminated due to prohibitive costs.
- **ADCPs and commercial flow meters** provide excellent accuracy but exceed budgetary and integration constraints.
- **Consumer fish finders** lack the precision and data interoperability required for research applications.


### **Benefits vs. Costs**

The **Blue Robotics Ping2 single-beam sonar** offers the best balance for depth mapping: affordable, accurate within ±5–15 cm, and open-source friendly.
 For flow measurement, the **YF-S201 sensor** provides a budget-conscious alternative. Although less precise than ADCPs, it offers sufficient accuracy (±10%) for a capstone project, particularly when validated against reference datasets. Its ease of integration and extremely low cost make it highly attractive.


### **Most Likely to Succeed**

The chosen configuration combines a **single-beam sonar transducer (Ping2 or equivalent)** for depth measurement with a **YF-S201 Hall-effect flow sensor** for current velocity monitoring. Together, these solutions maximize affordability, accuracy, and ease of integration. The sonar system achieves the project’s bathymetric goals within a reasonable budget, while the YF-S201 enables basic flow monitoring without requiring costly acoustic Doppler systems.
This hybrid approach balances technical feasibility with project constraints and provides a scalable platform that can be expanded with more advanced sensors in the future.

##**High-Level Solution**
The autonomous lake-mapping vessel integrates multiple coordinated subsystems to efficiently meet all stakeholder goals and project requirements while remaining within design constraints. The system combines a durable fiberglass-reinforced 3D-printed hull, efficient power management, and reliable communication to deliver accurate bathymetric mapping and autonomous navigation. High-precision sonar and water velocity sensors collect depth and location data, which are processed and transmitted via a wireless link to an on-shore computer for real-time monitoring. The modular battery configuration and optional solar backup ensure power reliability, while onboard SD storage prevents data loss in the event of communication failure. Lightweight materials, optimized control algorithms, and energy-efficient components reduce power consumption and maximize operational endurance. The design emphasizes safety, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness, achieving a balance between performance and resource optimization to provide a robust, autonomous, and user-friendly data collection platform.

The navigation subsystem and autopilot receive these data through the UART/USB interface to maintain accurate localization and velocity estimation. When RTK corrections are available, the module applies differential data via the RTCM3 stream to improve accuracy to sub-meter levels.
Each position message includes fixed quality, satellite count, and error dilution metrics (HDOP) to ensure reliability. If signal loss occurs, the module flags “no fix” and maintains the last known position with a timestamp.
The GPS subsystem is powered by the main DC distribution line (5 V nominal) and is mechanically mounted with a waterproof antenna to ensure optimal satellite visibility and durability in marine conditions.

Based on mission waypoints and path plans, the autopilot generates control commands for the propulsion and steering subsystems via PWM or CAN ESC interfaces. The system runs inner-loop attitude control at ≥50 Hz for stability and outer-loop navigation at 5–20 Hz for waypoint tracking.
Telemetry data—including battery level, GPS fix, EKF health, and mission progress—are sent to the ground station through the communication subsystem. In case of telemetry or GPS loss, the autopilot triggers failsafe behaviors such as loiter, stop, or return-to-home.

### Subsystem 4: (Communication)

The Communication and Data Processing Subsystem provides the primary link between the vessel’s onboard systems and the base station computer located on land. It manages both the transmission of collected sensor data—such as GPS coordinates, depth readings, and system status—and the reception of operator commands. The subsystem uses a wireless communication link, established through a Wi-Fi or RF telemetry module, to ensure reliable, real-time data transfer.
The onboard controller, a Raspberry Pi 4, serves as the central processing unit for managing communication and local data handling. In the event of a loss of connection, data are automatically stored on an onboard SD card to ensure no information is lost.
